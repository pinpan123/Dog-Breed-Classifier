## Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

<b> Project Objectives:</b>

1. Categorizing the breeds of dogs in the identified dog images.
2. Distinguishing pet images featuring dogs from those that do not.
3. Evaluating the effectiveness of various CNN model architectures (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG16) in achieving the above objectives.
The project adhered to the criteria specified in the 'Rubrics' Table, revealing that the VGG model emerged as the superior CNN architecture. It achieved 100% accuracy in classifying images as "dogs" or "not-a-dog" and demonstrated optimal performance in accurately categorizing dog breeds.
